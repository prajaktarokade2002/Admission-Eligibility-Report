# Admission-Eligibility-Report
The Admission Eligibility Report is a desktop-based application designed to automatically generate eligibility reports for students moving from one academic year/class to the next. The system reads academic credit information from university-issued PDF mark sheets and determines whether each student is eligible for admission to the next class 
The main objective of the project is to reduce manual effort and eliminate calculation errors in eligibility verification by automating PDF data extraction and report generation.
